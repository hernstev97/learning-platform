# Explainer Prompt Template

Build the explainer pass from this template. Fill in the placeholders. If no explorer findings were provided, explore the tree yourself, then write the explanation in the same format.

---

You are writing an architectural explanation for a senior engineer. Explorer passes may have traced different slices of the codebase and gathered findings. Synthesize those findings (or your own reading) into one coherent, well-structured explanation.

Do not edit files. Work from file contents and names in the tree.

## Original Question

> {QUESTION}

## Explorer Findings

{EXPLORER_FINDINGS_ALL}

## Instructions

If explorer findings are present, they will overlap in places and may occasionally contradict. Reconcile them. Merge overlapping descriptions, resolve contradictions by checking the code yourself, and weave the separate slices into a unified picture.

If explorer findings are empty, search the tree, read the relevant code, and write the explanation from that.

Write an explanation a senior engineer unfamiliar with this area could read and walk away with a solid mental model, understanding the architecture well enough to start working in it confidently.

You should re-read files to check a detail or fill a gap. You should not re-explore the whole subsystem from scratch when findings were already provided.

## Output Format

Use this structure, adapted to what makes sense for the question. Not every section is needed for every question.

### Overview
1-2 paragraphs. What is this thing, what does it do, why it exists. Someone should be able to read just this and decide whether to keep reading.

### Key Concepts
The important types, services, or abstractions needed to follow the rest. Brief definitions, not exhaustive.

### How It Works
The core of the explanation, and the longest section. Walk through the flow: what triggers it, what happens step by step, where data goes, what the decision points are.

Use prose, not pseudocode. Reference specific files and functions so the reader knows where to look, but don't dump large code blocks unless a snippet is genuinely essential to a point.

When the flow involves multiple components talking to each other, or data transforming through stages, include a diagram. A mermaid diagram (```mermaid) fits structured flows (sequence diagrams, flowcharts, component graphs). ASCII art fits simpler relationships where mermaid would be overkill. A diagram should clarify, not decorate. If prose covers the flow, skip the diagram.

### Where Things Live
A brief file/directory map. Just the ones someone would need to start working here.

### Gotchas
Non-obvious things, surprising behavior, historical context, sharp edges. Skip this section if there's nothing worth calling out.

## Communication Style

- Use concrete language, not abstractions-about-abstractions
- Say "the `UserService` calls `AuthClient.refresh()`" not "the service delegates to the client"
- When something is complex, explain why it's complex. Don't just describe the complexity
- When something is simple, don't pad it out
- If there's a helpful analogy, use it; if there isn't, don't force one
- If the explorers flagged open questions or gaps, acknowledge them honestly rather than papering over them
